[The Budget Tracker application on Heroku](https://aqueous-cove-81545.herokuapp.com)


## Task on this assignment
My challenge this week is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. I also need to deploy the application to Heroku.

This application should be a progessive web application that is installable.

## Tools and Software
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, MONGOOSE/MONGODB, EXPRESS.jS and NODE packages

## Usage

You can clone the repository and run npm i to install all packages. Open in your mobile phone, it will allow you to key in your expenses or assets while you are offline and it will be saved and appear when you are online. It is also installable by clicking the install icon on the address bar.
