## The deployed application
[The Budget Tracker application on Heroku](https://aqueous-cove-81545.herokuapp.com)


## Task on this assignment
My challenge this week is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. I also need to deploy the application to Heroku.

This application should be a progessive web appliaction that can is installable.

## Tools and Software
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, MONGOOSE/MONGODB, EXPRESS.jS and NODE packages

## The snapshot of the application
